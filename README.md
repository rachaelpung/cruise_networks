# Using high-resolution contact networks to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 transmission and control in large-scale multi-day events

This repository contains code and data to reconstruct social contact networks on cruise sailings and simulate SARS-CoV-2 Delta variant outbreaks to assess how different combinations of interventions and network formulations influence transmission in these large-scale multi-day events.

## Quick start guide
The edge (i.e. pairs of contact) and node (i.e. individuals in a network) list are:

dataContact.RData <br/>
dataNodes.RData

All other data are derived from the above two files or simulated.

The R scripts to perform the analysis and plots in the code folder.
